<H2>EXPERIENCE</H2>

<UL>

<LI><H4>2010--present: Research Associate, <A HREF="http://www.esrl.noaa.gov">NOAA/ESRL</A>, Boulder, CO</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Work with team developing next-generation data assimilation software for
  weather forecast models
  (<A HREF="https://www.jcsda.noaa.gov">https://www.jcsda.noaa.gov</A>). Thus
  far have successfully implemented thread-based parallelism in radiation code providing up to 8X
  speedup on a 12-core socket. 
<LI>Port my GPTL timing library
  (<A HREF="https://jmrosinski.github.io/GPTL">https://jmrosinski.github.io/GPTL</A>)
  to GPU to enable finer-grain timing than kernel-level, and include more
  information than provided by currently available GPU profilers.
<LI>Optimize performance of FIM, NIM, and FV3 forecast models on various
  supercomputing platforms, including Xeon Phi.
</UL>

<LI><H4>2008--2010: Climate Computational Scientist, <A HREF="http://www.ornl.gov">Oak Ridge National Lab</A>, Oak Ridge, TN</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Port climate models and other large application codes to Cray XT5 and other on-site hardware.
<LI>Optimize performance of application codes on supercomputing platforms.
<LI>Study application scalability and offer improvements where possible.
</UL>

<LI><H4>2006--2008: Senior Applications Engineer, SiCortex, inc., Maynard, MA</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Optimize performance of customer applications for start-up company (now defunct) which
    built high-performance Linux clusters from the silicon up. 
<LI>Develop open-source performance analysis tools, and integrate them into a
    set of supported software. Many are based on PAPI. 
<LI>Various customer-facing roles to sell and support the product line, including site visits.
</UL>

<BR>
<LI><H4>2005--2006: Software Engineer, <A HREF="http://www.boeing.com">The Boeing Corporation</A>, Kihei, HI</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Develop TCP sockets-based software to parallelize application codes for
    optimal performance on Linux clusters and other distributed architectures.
<LI>Refine earlier work on general-purpose timing library (GPTL) to minimize
    overhead.
</UL>

<BR>
<LI><H4>1986--2005: Software Engineer, <A HREF="http://www.ncar.ucar.edu">
                   National Center for Atmospheric Research</A>,
                   Boulder, CO</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Part of a team building <A HREF="http://www.ccsm.ucar.edu/models/atm-cam">
    Community Atmosphere Model (CAM)<A>.  This model is used by researchers 
    worldwide for climate studies.
<LI>Parallelized CAM and its precursors, CCM2 and CCM3, for optimal execution
    on shared-memory and distributed-memory multi-processor platforms.
<LI>Devised and <A HREF=#PUB1>published a method to validate ports</A> of 
    atmospheric numerical models to new computing environments.
<LI>Wrote thread-safe general-purpose timing library
    (GPTL) for profiling application performance.
    It is callable from C, C++, and Fortran.
<LI>Presented tutorials on running climate models as part of CCM workshops.
<LI>Served on procurement teams for acquiring new supercomputing hardware.
</UL>

<BR>
<LI><H4>1983--1986: Software Engineer, Applied Research Corporation,
                Landover, MD.</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Implemented and modified atmospheric general circulation model on CDC
    Cyber 205 vector computer.
<LI>Vectorized code and developed post-processing software.
