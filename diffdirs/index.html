<b>diffdirs.pl</b> is a Perl script to show the differences between files in
    2 directory hierarchies. Download it <A HREF="diffdirs.pl">here.</a>
    Usage is: 
<pre>
diffdirs.pl [-s suffix] [-v] [-1] [-2] dir1 dir2
 -s suffix => only compare files ending in <b>suffix</b>
 -i suffix => never compare files ending in <b>suffix</b>
 -v        => verbose: show diffs and stop on each file with non-zero diffs
 -1        => list files only in first dir hierarchy
 -2        => list files only in second dir hierarchy
</pre>

As an example usage, here's how one might determine which files ending in
.F90 differ, and how, between one directory hierarchy and another:
<pre>
diffdirs.pl -s F90 -v ~/POP_LANL/ ~/POP_LANL_MODIFIED/
</pre>

This will compare only files which end in the suffix F90, and exist in the
same place in both subdirectory hierarchies. It will list the
diffs for each file encountered (the -v option).
